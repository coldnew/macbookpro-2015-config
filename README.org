* Which devices work ?

So...you want to install Gentoo Linux on MacBook Pro 2015 ? Here's what I got:

** Wifi

The official =broadcom-sta-6.30.223.248-r3= driver doesnt seem to like =BCM43602= which is used in MBPR 12,1, so we should use a kernel provided driver =brcfmac=.

Use the =brcmfmac= driver shipped with the linux kernel to enable wifi, you also need to install =sys-kernel/linux-firmware= for =/lib/firmware/brcm/brcmfmac43602-pcie.bin=.

I use =/etc/portage/savedconfig/sys-kernel/linux-firmware= to control which firmware I need to install, and the firmware we need to make wifi work is

: brcm/brcmfmac43602-pcie.bin

Add the savedconfig file, and enable =savedconfig= USE to emerge linux-firmware

: USE="savedconfig" emerge sys-kernel/linux-firmware

** TouchPad

Works great! two finger scrolling and left/right button can work.

** Suspend

Appears to work, I use the =suspend to RAM= method

** SD Card Reader

   SD card reader has been not worked for a long time, after I upgraded to =macOS Sierra= version =10.12.6= , it works now :P.

   You should have the following =lsusb= info:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     Bus 002 Device 002: ID 05ac:8406 Apple, Inc.
     Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
     Bus 001 Device 003: ID 05ac:0273 Apple, Inc. Internal Keyboard/Trackpad (ISO)
     Bus 001 Device 002: ID 05ac:8290 Apple, Inc. Bluetooth Host Controller
     Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   The device =05ac:8406= is the sdcard reader, make sure it exists or not.

** Bluetooth

TODO: find related config files (current in my kernel setting)

* QA

** TODO Users with id (501) not shown in GDM ?

   NOTE: I think I am wrong, cant' make this work yet.


   To make compatible with my Mac, I changed the Linux user to =uid:gid 501:20=, and found there's no user listed in GDM,
   this may be due to =/etc/login.defs= having values like

   : UID_MIN                  1000

   change it to following, and the user will show up (maybe ?)

   : UID_MIN                   500

** How to add "Mac OSX" to grub menu

Just add the following entry to =/etc/grub.d/40_custom=

#+begin_src sh
menuentry "Mac OSX" {
    insmod hfsplus
    search --set=root --file /System/Library/CoreServices/boot.efi
    chainloader /System/Library/CoreServices/boot.efi
}
#+end_src

Then use these commands to rebuild grub menu.

: grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg


** Boot hang on "switch to clocksource tsc" [FIXED in 4.1-rc3]

If you have a problem booting the system properly and encounter an error such as

: switch to clocksource tsc

you can revert commit =7bc5a2b= "ACPI: Support _OSI("Darwin") correctly" or apply patch list in
