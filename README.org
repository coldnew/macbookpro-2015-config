* Which device can work ?

So...you want to install Gentoo Linux on MacBook Pro 2015 ? Here's what I got:

** Wifi

The official =broadcom-sta-6.30.223.248-r3= driver seams like not support =BCM43602= which used in MBPR 12,1, we should use a kernel provide driver =brcfmac=.

Use =brcmfmac= driver shipped with linux kernel can let wifi work, you also need to install =sys-kernel/linux-firmware= for =/lib/firmware/brcm/brcmfmac43602-pcie.bin=.

I use =/etc/portage/savedconfig/sys-kernel/linux-firmware= to control which firmware I need to install, and the firmware we need to make wifi work is

: brcm/brcmfmac43602-pcie.bin

Add the savedconfig file and enable =savedconfig= USE to emerge linux-firmware

: USE="savedconfig" emerge sys-kernel/linux-firmware


** TouchPad

Works great! two finger scrolling and left/right button can work.

** Suspend

Seems like work, I use =suspend to RAM= method

** SD Card Reader

I rembered when I first test linux on Macbook, it was worked. It can't be detect now in latest kernel (why?)

Here's my lsusb info:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation
  Bus 001 Device 003: ID 05ac:0273 Apple, Inc.
  Bus 001 Device 002: ID 05ac:8290 Apple, Inc.
  Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation
#+END_EXAMPLE

Here the SD Card device is missing, but I think it's device ID should be =05ac:8406=.

** Bluetooth

TODO: find related config files (current in my kernel setting)

* QA

** TODO Users with id (501) not show in GDM ?

   NOTE: I think I am wrong, cant' make this work yet.


   To make compatible with my Mac, I change Linux user to =uid:gid 501:20=, and find there's no user list in GDM,
   this may due to =/etc/login.defs= has value like

   : UID_MIN                  1000

   change it to following and uer will showup (maybe ?)

   : UID_MIN                   500

** TODO Why I can't connect with =ssh=

   I don't konw, I still trying to figure out problems, but I this it's
   =brcmfmac= drivers bug, since I can connect to github with ssh if I use my cellphone as ethernet bridge.

   NOTE: I can use =brcmfmac= driver to use with ssh in my company's router,
   maybe it's some problem conflict with router?

** Boot hang on "switch to clocksource tsc" [FIXED in 4.1-rc3]

If you has problem to boot system properly and encounter error such as

: switch to clocksource tsc

you can revert commit =7bc5a2b= "ACPI: Support _OSI("Darwin") correctly" or apply patch list in
